    <!-- INTRO -->
      <section class="intro">
        <p>By classic restaurant industry standards, Chipotle Mexican Grill does everything wrong. Its restaurants aren’t in the busiest locations. It spends too much money on food. It doesn’t serve breakfast; it doesn’t do drive-throughs, airport stores, franchises, or even much in the way of advertising. It almost never adds anything new to its menu. Employees still cut all the tomatoes — hundreds of thousands every day — by hand. It is, in so many ways, the anti-McDonald’s.</p>

        <p>Which is strange, particularly when you consider that Chipotle spent roughly eight years under McDonald’s corporate arches. McDonald’s early investment in the burrito chain gave it capital to grow, an inside look at the supply-chain economics, the know-how it needed to manage its expansion from 13 stores in 1998 to more than 500 stores in 2006. For its investment — $340 million in total by the time of Chipotle’s IPO — McDonald’s got a nice little return. It turned out to be the short end of the stick. </p>
        
        <p>In the years since their split, Chipotle’s rapid growth and consistently astonishing financial results have made it a darling of investors. Its commitment to fresh, high-quality ingredients at only slightly higher prices have helped to define a new wave of “fast casual” dining. And McDonald’s … well, everyone knows what’s happened to McDonald’s. As consumers’ tastes changed, the chain became the poster-child for America’s obesity epidemic. Sales slumped and the stock price followed. Last week, CEO Don Thompson was replaced by Steve Easterbrook, the company’s chief brand officer. Easterbrook has one job: to get the iconic chain back on some kind of track at a time when Chipotle and its ilk are ascendant.</p>

            <img src="img/same-store-sales_700.png" alt="" />
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>The story of Chipotle’s meteoric rise is also the story of McDonald’s failure to recognize the changing American appetite. To understand both, we interviewed dozens of people involved with Chipotle, from its inception in founder and CEO Steve Ells’ Colorado dining room through its time at McDonald’s to today. McDonald’s declined to make current company leaders available for this story, but we were able to talk to many of the company’s former executives, including several that now work for Chipotle.</p>
        
        <p>In Ells’ telling, the company has thrived on high-quality food and accommodating workers — and because Ells created a highly efficient way to cook, one that had nothing to do with the established, pre-cooked, reheat-and-serve fast-food model. The funny thing is, Ells never really wanted to spend much time in the burrito business at all.</p>

          <p class="text">At Steve’s dinner parties, there was always a lot of braising meats, duck confit, roasts. So one time I said, “What are we having?” and he said, “Burritos.” I remember being extraordinarily disappointed, because how good can a burrito be? My dad and I went to his house with a number of other people, and that's where I ate the first Chipotle burrito. It was absolutely delicious.</p>

The break-even was he had to sell 114 burritos a day.</p>

          <h2>The McDonald’s Era (1998-2005)</h2>
          <br /><br />
          <h3>McDonald’s committed around $50 million per year to Chipotle. It was a relatively small amount for the burger giant, which had made a $1.6 billion profit in 1998, but significant for the burrito chain, which by then had 13 stores. For its investment, McDonald’s got to show Wall Street that it was diversifying and growing. Chipotle got cash, access to a massive supply chain, institutional know-how, and plenty of well-intentioned advice.</h3>

You wanted to either be served or have it be dirt-cheap. …And the more you increase customer participation in a service setting, generally the less control you have over it.

Even if [McDonald’s] wanted to change the quality substantially, it would be a very hard thing to do within the economic environment of McDonald's. … What will happen is that these new ones will start out with the right economics, the right ingredients, and then slowly displace the other guys over time.</p>
